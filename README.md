# Breaking a captcha (based on pictures of humans and non-humans)

This code is intended as a fun project to gain familiarity
with the basics of machine learning algorithms.
The particular example is the captcha provided on the APS

The authors of the code have no intent in performing bulk-downloads
of paywall-blocked data or any related illegal activity.
